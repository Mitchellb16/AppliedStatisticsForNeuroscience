You'll need to begin by following the
[installation instructions](https://github.com/charlesfrye/AppliedStatisticsForNeuroscience/blob/master/Part%2000%20-%20Setup%20and%20Review/00%20-%20Setup/Installation%20Instructions.md)
to set up your computing environment for this course.
We'll be using Python 3 inside of Jupyter notebooks,
along with a variety of standard libraries for working with data.

Once your environment is ready to go,
make sure the folder `Tech Tools Tutorial`
is in your course folder, under `Part 00 - Setup and Review/00 - Setup`.

If you're on OS X or Linux,
open up a terminal
and type in

```
source activate neur299
```
and hit enter, then type
```
jupyter notebook
```
and hit enter.

If you're on Windows, open up a
command prompt window
and type in
```
activate neur299
```
and hit enter, then type
```
jupyter notebook
```
and hit enter.

A browser window should open up, and you should see a list of files.
Even though this is inside your internet browser,
it's actually a list of files on your own computer.
Navigate to the folder ```Tech Tools Tutorial```
and open up the file
```Using Jupyter Notebooks.ipynb```.

The homeworks and tutorials for this course will all be in this format,
and this notebook contains a tutorial on how to use Jupyter notebooks.

The remainder of the notebooks in the folder describe how
to use the other tools we'll be using in the course:

- the **Python** programming language
- the **pandas** data management library
- the **seaborn** plotting package
- the **LaTeX** typesetting language

listed in order of importance.

Reading through the first three tutorials
(i.e., those on Jupyter, Python, and pandas)
will help you prepare for the first section.
