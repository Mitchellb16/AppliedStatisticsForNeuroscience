    "The meaning of a statement like \"the chance that I roll a die and it comes up 6 is 1/6\" is both intuitively obvious and flabbergastingly difficult to pin down. Indeed, the foundations of probability are a topic for [philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/probability-interpret/) as much as or more than for mathematics. Four alternative interpretations of that statement appear below: \n",
    "\n",
    "- If I were to prepare a large number of dice identical to this one and roll them all at once, about 1/6 of them would come up 6\n",
    "- If I were to examine all possible universes consistent with my beliefs right now, then 1/6 of them contain me rolling a die that comes up as a 6\n",
    "- If I wish to think logically about the statement \"the die comes up a 6\", then, given my current knowledge, I should assign the truth value 1/6 (where 1 is definitely true and 0 is definitely false)\n",
    "- The mathematical rules that I need to apply to games involving rolling dice in order to avoid being cheated tell me to assign the number 1/6 to the event \"the die comes up a 6\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of these interpretations you prefer is, in the end, an aesthetic choice. The lattermost view, due to [de Finetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_de_Finetti), is known as the [\"Dutch Book\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_book) argument and is popular among financial mathematicians and stock traders. The formermost view, the [*frequentist* view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_probability), is most popular among practicing scientists and is the \"traditional\" view among statisticians. The second and third views are two flavors of [*Bayesianism*](http://charlesfrye.github.io/stats/2016/02/04/bayes-rule.html), and are popular among cognitive and computer scientists and the current generation of statisticians. The third is forcefully argued for by [Edwin Jaynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Thompson_Jaynes) in his posthumous work *Probability Theory: The Logic of Science*.\n",

Armed with a few common sense ideas -- the probability that \"something happens\" is always 1, nothing can have a negative probability, and the probability of either of two things happening is at least as much as one of them happening -- we can define two important notions: the *probability mass function* and the *probability density function*. These are both examples of *probability distributions*."

    "### Probability Mass Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "If I roll a die, only one of 6 things might happen -- I'll get a number from 1 to 6. One die might be well-made and fair, and so each number will have the same chance of showing up. Another die might be poorly-made, and so there will be some small variations in those chances. Another die might be intentionally made unfair, and so there will be some big variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'd like to be able to describe the differences between these dice with numbers. We do this by defining, for each die, a function that takes in a number between 1 and 6 and spits out the probability that rolling the die will result in that number. We call this the *probability mass function*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why *mass function*? Remember two of our common sense ideas about probability: nothing can have a negative probability, and the probability of either of two things happening is at least as much as one of them happening. These are the same restrictions that we have when we're talking about the masses of objects: nothing can have a negative mass, and the mass of two things is at least as much as the mass of one of the objects (why is the mass of two objects not the sum of the masses of the individual objects? What happens if our two objects are \"my arm\" and \"my whole body\"?).\n",
    "\n",
    "The closest physical analogue to the probability mass function for a (possibly loaded) die is the mass function for a box of six rocks. For each rock, the mass function tells me how much mass it has, a number which cannot be negative. If I add up the masses of all of the rocks, I get the total mass of the collection of rocks. A fair die, one on which all faces have the same chance of landing up, like the ones we normally use for games of chance, would be like a box with six rocks that all weigh the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, then, probabilities are like masses. We put a lot of \"mass\" on events that are likely to occur and less \"mass\" on events that are unlikely. One big difference between probability and physical mass is that the \"total mass\" for a probability mass function is always one."

Note that the \"first\" item in a list is, in Python, at index `0`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Probability mass functions are useful, but there are some situations where they're not enough. For example, say I throw a dart at a circular dartboard and ask where it landed. There are so many possible places that the dart could land that it's impossible to list them all, even with infinite time (this is called an *uncountable infinity*). We need to be able to list something in order to define a probability mass function, so we need something new to handle these cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce the *probability density function* by analogy to the densities we encounter in the physical world. The density function of an object tells you how its mass is distributed -- where there is more mass per unit volume, the density is higher, and where there is less, the density is lower. We can use density functions to calculate how much mass there is in each and every part of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the density is the same across the whole object, we can just multiply this constant density value by the volume of the part we're interested in to get the mass. For complicated objects, like humans and laptop computers, the density will be very different at different points. If we want to know how approximately much an object weighs, we need to take a whole bunch of small volumes and add up how much mass is in each of them. The smaller the volumes we take, the more accurate our measurement of the mass will be -- the density can't change too much if the volume is small. Using calculus, we can describe mathematically what happens when our volumes are \"infinitely small\" and so the mass we calculate will be exactly correct. You may be familiar with this idea, which is called an *integral*.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, just like the density function is the function we integrate in order to get the mass of any part of an object, a probability density function is the function we integrate in order to get the probability of any group of events out of the possible outcomes. Again, we want the chance that \"something happens\" to be 1, so we say that the integral of a probability density function is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also just like regular density, the probability density at a given point can be higher than the total probability. For example, the density of human bone is roughly 2000 kg/m$^3$, but humans weigh much less than 2000 kilograms. Similarly, the density of probability in one region might be more than 1, even though the total amount of probability is always exactly 1.\n",
