The empirical CDF, unlike the mean or the variance, gets harder to describe as we get more data: to write down an empirical CDF, you need to know the location of each \"step\" in the function -- of each data point -- while to know the mean or variance you only need one number. Bootstrap models were also more computationally expensive and performed worse on models that came from parametric distributions."

    "Some folks like to lump neural networks in with non-parametric models. For them, the key property of non-parametric models is that they solve our expressivity problem and, relatedly, don't make strong assumptions about the kinds of relationships that might be in the data. Non-parametric models and neural networks are similar in this regard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though I understand where this perspective is coming from, I think it's somewhat confusing, especially since polynomial models can also be very expressive, especially when they have as many degrees as neural networks have parameters (in the tens, if not hundreds, of thousands!). It's also absolutely the case that neural networks have parameters, so folks find themselves in the awkward position of having a \"non-parametric\" model that has parameters!"

The most common model is called **LOWESS**, for **LO**cally **WE**ighted **S**catterplot **S**moothing. It's a local regression model and can be thought of as a smoother version of nearest-neighbor regression, hence the first, third, and fourth words in its name. At each possible value for $x$, we fit a (possibly linear) regression model to the nearest datapoints, with more emphasis on the datapoints that have the the most similar $x$ values. Mathematically, the emphasis shows up as a *weight* that increases or decreases the contribution of data points to each model, explaining the second term in the method's name."
