Another common argument is that, for most optimization problems, we think of \"minimizing a cost\" rather than \"maximizing a reward\" -- finding the shortest distance between two points, reducing expenditures for a business, spending the least energy -- and we want to connect our problem as closely as possible to other optimization problems, so that we can make as much use as possible of other work.\n",

If $\\theta$ is a vector, then the derivative is a vector that contains the derivative of the cost function with respect to each element of $\\theta$. We call this the *gradient*. The gradient vector points in the direction which makes the cost function go up the most, also known as the *direction of steepest ascent*, which is the opposite of the direction which makes the cost function go down the most, the *direction of steepest descent*. So to make the cost function go down as fast as possible, we multiply the gradient vector by -1 (flipping it around) and take a small step in that direction.\n",
